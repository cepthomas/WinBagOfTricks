A place to play with some Windows stuff.

- Tray application demo. Still works and could be useful.
- Clipboard with multiple entries. Not needed with builtin Win10/11 clipboard.
- A simple taskbar/jumplist manager. Still works and could be useful.
- General purpose Win32 library that is used in my other applications.
- Requires VS2022 and .NET8.
- Bunch of test files.

# External Components

- WindowsAPICodePack: old/stale but still works.
- Bits and pieces found on the interwebs.
